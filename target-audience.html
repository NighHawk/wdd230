        <h1>Pullman Washington Chamber of Commerce
            <br>Website Planning Document</h1>
        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>The audience in which I desire to target are visitors to the area. This will help them get to know
            the palouse and what the palouse has to offer them. I would also want to target potential businesses.
            This will allow them to know who to contact and where to  go to get the neccessary information needed
            to get aquainted with Pullman. Another audience would be those who are living here as residence already.
            This site would help them know who to contact for the ideas or help that they are in need of. Lastly, I would
            want to attract potential students of Washington State University. This site would allow them to see what Pullman
            and the Palouse is all about.
