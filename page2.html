        <h3>Contrast</h3>

          I really like how the way they use contrast of both colors and fonts.
          With the colors, we see how they have the initial background as being white,
          but they also use several other eye popping colors to make it look more
          interesting. The same thing with the fonts. We see some are plain but 
          others are bolded or even different colors. Both of these help the site
          catch our eyes and make it look more interesting.

        <h3>Alignment</h3>

        <p>
          With the ESPN website, as I look at the home page as well as most of 
          the other pages. I see that they have everything aligned straight down 
          the center. With this it's easy to see where everything is and while I 
          read the different sections, I am not constantly looking around the 
          screen trying to find what I am looking for. Everything is easy to read 
          and find while keeping everything aligned right down the center. On the 
          other hand, they have a lot of blank white space on the sides. This to me 
          is a little distracting and ugly.

        <h3>Proximity</h3>
        <h4>Google<br><br><a href="https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl">Google</a></h4>

          What I like about Googles homepage is that when you arrive, the main image
          and search area are right at eye level and in the upper middle of the screen.
          This is nice and well done with seeing that each piece is in an easy 
          to spot location where you aren't looking around the entire screen trying
          to find where to type in your search. To me, I feel like its classy in the sense
          that there is a lot there but nothing really at all. The image and search bar
          are big enough to fill space but there isn't a ton of random stuff on there 
          to distract from the use of the site.
